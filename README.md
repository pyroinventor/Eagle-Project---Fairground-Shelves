# Eagle Project - Fairground Shelves

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to design and build new shelves for my local county fair. This involved meeting with several fair superintendents to discuss their specific needs to come up with a customized, optimal design for each department.

## Why was this project needed?
The fair board wanted to use the youth exhibit building for a storage rental space to generate income during the off season, so they needed a more portable shelving solution. Here are some before pictures:

As you can see, the shelves were warped, permanently fixed to the wall, and starting to fall apart. For some departments, the lack of proper shelving made it difficult to effectively show off what the youth have been working on due to factors such as size, weight, and accesibility. I saw an opportunity to completely redisign the shelves, making them portable and customized to the needs of each department.

## Project Execution

### Planning
I first needed the approval of the fair board, so I contacted the fair president and we arranged a meeting to discuss the issues I covered in the goal section. With this info, I put together a project proposal and presented it at a fair board meeting. I was given a budget and the go ahead, so I got to work. 

### Shelf Design
With the budget in mind, I sent some possible shelf designs to each of the superintendents to get their feedback. Here are some of my preliminary designs:

In addition to the deptartment's needs, I did my best to optimize the shelf designs to efficiently use up 4 x 8 plywood sheathing and 8 foot 2 x 4s to reduce lumber costs.

I was initially going to use all hybrid shelving (2x4 frames with plywood shelf tops), but the woodworking dept. required the vertical space flexibility of stadium shelves.

After some back and forth I came up with a combo of shelving styles; stadium and hybrid.

This is what I ended up building. 

### Removal of Old Shelves
To remove the old shelves, I enlisted the help of 12 volunteers consisting of family, friends, and fellow scouts. It was difficult to coordinate schedules, but we eventually got a date set. I was lucky to have a volunteer with construction experience, so the demo day was very productive and we finished with time to spare.

We piled up the old lumber to be used for another project, swept up all the debris, removed some fencing at the superintendant's request, and called it a day. Everyone signed in and logged their hours for my report.

### Pre-assembly of New Shelves
With the old shelves out, it was time to build the new ones. I decided to cut all the lumber and pre-assemble what I could at home, so I could fit everything in a minivan to drive to the site. After a lot of sawing and pre drilling clearance holes, pilot holes, and countersinking, I had the 2x4 frames and plywood shelf tops done.

Test fit to make sure everything is correct.

The most difficult part was cutting the stringers for the stadium shelves. My dad and I made a custom jig to be used with a circular saw to make it easier, but it still took several hours to cut everything out of the 4x8' sheaths. \
With all the sub-assemblies ready, I loaded up the van, stopped at the hardware store for wood screws and driver bits, and headed over to the fairgrounds to finish assembly.

### Final Assembly 
I scheduled another work day to prep all the lumber for assembly. My team and I got all the lumber unloaded, sanded all the rough corners, and got everything swept and organized for the final assembly. Due to BSA project rules, other scouts weren't allowed to use power tools, so my dad, sister and I got to work on nailing, screwing, and fitting the shelves together:

The hybrid shelves were free standing, but we made wall mounts for the stadium shelves to prevent them from sliding around while keeping them removable.

After the last screw was in place and all the leveling feet were adjusted, here is the final result!

One board of review and eagle scout ceremony later:

## Conclusion

Thanks to the encouragment and guidance of my scout leader, the carpentry advice from my dad, the time and effort of my team of volunteers, and a lot of hard work, the youth in my community have a better platform to display their projects at the country fair. Thanks for reading!
